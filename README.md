# ChakulaPap
ChakulaPap is an Uber for food. Order food the same way you would order an Uber and have it delivered to your location. Currently the app allows only peer to peer food ordering. Planning on Implementing Google Maps API for Location services. This is a Fun project and anyone is welcome to help improve it.

Once you login to the App, you will see a List of food items uploaded by food providers near you. On Sign up there are two account types you can choose from. Based on that, on login you will be redirected to the proper Activity depending on account type. (Will upload Provider Account View screenshots soon)

We use fragments in this app, thus the three tabs with different views. On pressing order, an alert box pops asking for confirmation of that particular order, after which a server request is sent and relevant database fields are updated with the order details. For the Database I use MySql. If interested in being part of the project or improving on, do let me know so I can wire those php scripts to you real quick (^_^)
