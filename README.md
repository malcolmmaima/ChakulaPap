# ChakulaPap
ChakulaPap is an Uber for food. Order food the same way you would order an Uber and have it delivered to your location. Currently the app allows only peer to peer food ordering. Planning on Implementing Google Maps API for Location services. This is a Fun project and anyone is welcome to help improve it.

Sorry about the login credentials confusion, you'll notice after login the Activity title is Malcolm Maima(thats because I later logged in with a different account - mine and took the screenshots for testing purposes. Build the app and have a go at it *wink wink* )
</p>
    
Once you login to the App, you will see a List of food items uploaded by food providers near you. On Sign up there are two account types you can choose from. Based on that, after login you will be redirected to the proper Activity depending on account type. (Will upload Provider Account View screenshots soon)


<h2>Customer Account</h2>

We use fragments in this app, thus the three tabs with different views. On pressing order, an alert box pops asking for confirmation of that particular order, after which a server request is sent and relevant database fields are updated with the order details. For the Database I use MySql. If interested in being part of the project or improving on, do let me know so I can wire those php scripts to you real quick (^_^)

<h2>Customer Account (Send Order)</h2>

Confirm order and a server request is sent to an orders table that will be fetched by provider accounts, they can either accept or decline the order.

<h2>Simple php Dashboard</h2>
<p>
Oh, and did I mention that I also made a simple php backend.(Still working on it but so far this is what I have...)

We can edit the current menu items being displayed in the app from the backend. Hopefully add some more cool stuff to our backend.
