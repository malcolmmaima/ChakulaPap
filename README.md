# ChakulaPap
ChakulaPap is an Uber for food. Order food the same way you would order an Uber and have it delivered to your location. Currently the app allows only peer to peer food ordering. Planning on Implementing Google Maps API for Location services. This is a Fun project and anyone is welcome to help improve it.
